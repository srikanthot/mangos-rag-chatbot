"""Query rewriter — reformulates follow-up questions into standalone search queries.

When a user asks "explain more about this" or "what about the technical requirements",
the retrieval system has no context from the prior conversation. This module uses a
fast LLM call to rewrite such follow-up questions into self-contained search queries
that include the necessary context (e.g., equipment type, kV rating, topic).

The rewrite only fires when there is conversation history AND the question looks like
a follow-up (short, contains pronouns/demonstratives, lacks technical specificity).
