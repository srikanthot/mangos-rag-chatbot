"""Pre-retrieval intent classifier for the MANGOS Tech Manual Chatbot.

Classifies user input BEFORE the RAG pipeline runs.  Three outcomes:

  - GREETING / CHITCHAT / ACKNOWLEDGEMENT / SELF_DESCRIPTION / GIBBERISH
        → Return a canned friendly response.  No search, no LLM call.
  - VAGUE_QUERY
        → Return a polite clarification request.  No search, no LLM call.
  - TECHNICAL_QUESTION
        → Proceed to the full RAG pipeline (retrieve → gate → generate).

This module intentionally uses only deterministic pattern matching — no LLM
call — so it adds zero latency and zero cost.  The patterns are tuned for
a field-technician audience using a technical manual chatbot.
