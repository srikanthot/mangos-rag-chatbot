"""RagContextProvider — official Agent Framework ContextProvider for RAG.
 
Implements the Agent Framework BaseContextProvider hook pattern.
 
Before each LLM call (before_run):
  - Reads pre-retrieved Azure AI Search results from session.state
    (placed there by AgentRuntime.run_stream before calling agent.run).
  - Formats them into numbered evidence blocks via build_context_blocks.
  - Injects the formatted context as additional instructions via
    context.extend_instructions(), which the framework appends to the
    agent's system prompt before the model call.
 
After each LLM call (after_run):
  - No-op for now; Cosmos DB / audit storage can be added here later.
 
This is what makes the repo a true Agent Framework implementation:
RAG context injection is a first-class ContextProvider, not ad-hoc
string formatting inside the orchestrator.
