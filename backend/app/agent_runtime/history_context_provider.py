"""CosmosHistoryProvider — Agent Framework ContextProvider for cold-start history.
 
When the backend restarts, the in-process InMemoryHistoryProvider is empty even
though prior conversation turns exist in Cosmos DB.  This provider bridges the gap:
 
  1. AgentRuntime loads the last N messages from Cosmos and formats them into a
     single text block, then stores that block in af_session.state under
     _HISTORY_BLOCK_KEY.
 
  2. On the first agent.run() call for a cold-started session, before_run() reads
     the block, injects it into the system instructions via context.extend_instructions(),
     and removes it from state so it only fires once.
 
  3. From the second turn onward, InMemoryHistoryProvider takes over and provides
     the growing in-process message history automatically.
 
Result: the LLM always has prior conversation context, whether the session is warm
(InMemoryHistoryProvider has it) or cold (we inject from Cosmos once).
